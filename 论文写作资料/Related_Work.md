Xxxx is widely used in many application domains, such as: xxx.（第一句话简单介绍技术的背景和使用场景）
（第二句话介绍难点）
Due to the high computational complexity, many existing algorithms have been developed for efficient computation of these two variants of xxx, which can be divided into three camps (cf. Table xx).（指明通过什么标准对现有的方法进行的分类，cf.此处是“查阅”的意思）

In the first camp, researchers propose xxxxx.（一句话总结）. 具体的例子. 缺点总结.
In the second camp, researchers propose xxx（一句话总结）. 具体的例子. 缺点总结.
In the third camp, which we are interested in, researchers propose different xxx（一句话总结）. 具体的例子. 缺点总结.

总结缺点的句子：
针对第一阵营：However, this type of methods normally does not provide xxxx.
针对第二阵营：
However, the large preprocessing time is not acceptable in our setting, since xxxx （解释原因）.
In addition, unlike xxx methods for xxx, since these methods do not discuss how to appropriately xxxx, they do not support xxx. 
针对第三阵营：
However, these methods cannot provide xxx.
In addition, xxx cannot provide fast evaluation in our setting (e.g., xx). 在我们指定的场景下性能不好

# 案例：用在开头总结本文综述的重点

Visualization is a board topic studied in many communities. Here we mainly focues on efficiency-related works. xxxxx.

Due to the importance of outlier detection, numerous outlier detection methods [2, 3, 5, 23, 41] have been proposed. 
In general, these methods can be divided into two categories: supervised and unsupervised methods. 
The supervised methods require labeled outliers to train a binary classification model. However, since xxxx（缺点及原因）. 
Crowdsourcing-based methods, like CrowdER [44], leverage humans to judiciously select questions in order to reduce the cost. However, they incur huge costs when used to address the outlier detection problem, because they ask humans to label many pairs of objects.
